See the response schema tab for detailed metrics definitions.\n\nThe response contains metrics for up to 28 days prior. Usage metrics are processed once per day for the previous day,\nand the response will only include data up until yesterday. In order for an end user to be counted towards these metrics,\nthey must have telemetry enabled in their IDE.\n\nOnly owners and billing managers can view Copilot usage metrics for the enterprise.\n\nOAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need either the `manage_billing:copilot` or `read:enterprise` scopes to use this endpoint.",
